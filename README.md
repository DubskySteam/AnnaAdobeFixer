## Purpose
Adobe Creative Cloud sucks, as does their uninstaller which in rare instances can brick the permissions of your windows user on certain paths.
This program simply creates full permissions of your user on every path Adobe needs to work.

## What it does

Sets full-control permissions on these paths:

- C:\Windows\temp
- C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Local\Temp
- C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Local\Packages
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe
- C:\Program Files\Adobe
- C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe
